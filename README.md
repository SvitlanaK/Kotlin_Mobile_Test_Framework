# Kotlin_Mobile_Test_Framework
This Framework for mobile testing using android and ios real devices.
I used:
1. Kotlin - programming language I want to learn
2. Maven - because I hate gradle, but one day I'll try to use gradle
3. Selenide - I think it is the best library with good implicit/explicit waits and understandable assertions
4. Guice - the library for quick page initialization (more beautiful than create page object in every test or do it by reflection)
5. Allure - for creating test execution reports that are clear to everyone in the team
6. TestNG - because Junit needs static methods for BeforeClass/AfterClass annotations and TestNG not (Kotlin doesn't have static)
